## Introduction

This blog describes some of the bugs I encountered whilst developing my game Taiga in Rust using WGPU.

There is (at the time of me writing this) very little content on the internet (apart from this great [tutorial](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/) to start with and a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/) for Rust game development) for WGPU developers in Rust, and this blog was started to share some knowledge and experience.

Feel free to PR this project if you spot any mistakes or have some additional knowledge to share that you see fit for this blog.
